				Since this site's aim is showing friends and fam what I am up to, I guess it's a good time to talk about the site itself (building it is what I've been up to a lot). So here's the cliffs:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Backend:</strong>
				Python with the Flask framework, running on Nginx in a Docker container. No database at the moment. Probably gonna give Mongo a spin though.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Frontend:</strong>
				Jinja2, Bootstrap 4 with flexbox, and JQuery 3. For asset compilation I've been having fun with Gulp and it's various plugins. Also Sass.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>
			<strike>
				I'm currently in the process of building this thing out. In the meantime, please enjoy:

				I am probably gonna have this graphic on the front page forever, because I love it, so I hope you do too.
